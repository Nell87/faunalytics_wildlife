# FAUNALYTICS WILDLIFE
In this project, we will be working with an existing dataset to produce estimates of the imports of various wildlife and wildlife products year-over-year

## USAGE

- **Create a GitHub PAT**. Users must have a GitHub personal access token set up to ensure complete lemis package functionality. 
  - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and generate a new token. 
  - Give it a nickname that reminds you of the intended purpose, e.g., “lemis_package”. 
  - Selecting the repo scope should be sufficient for lemis package use.
  - After you click “Generate token”, the token will be displayed. It’s a string of 40 random letters and digits.
  - Detail instructions can be found [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#step-by-step) if you have doubts. 
  
 - **Add your PAT to your .Renviron file**. Have a line that looks like this:
    > GITHUB_PAT=8c70fd8419398999c9ac5bacf3192882193cadf2
    
 - **Install Rtools from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)**
  
 - **Run the project_setup file for installing some packages**
 - **Everything is ready!** Open the report file for taking a look to the dataset
