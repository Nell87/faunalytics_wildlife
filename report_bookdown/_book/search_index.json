For this purpose, we’ll review 15 years (2000-2014) of data from the Law Enforcement Managment Information System (LEMIS), originally collected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), cleaned, standardized and stored into a R package called lemis by EcoHealth Alliance. You can find more information more about this dataset Here. 7.2 METHOD AND DATA INCLUDED The data collected by EcoHealth Alliance includes records of plants, microorganisms and animals, among others. For this analysis, we’ll exclude those elements belonging to fungi, plantae, bacteria, chromista and unspecified kingdoms, considering only those organisms of the Kingdom Animalia. Between January 01, 2000, and December 31, 2014, around 2 millions wildlife shipments were imported into the United States, involving around 11,5 billions of wildlife items plus 1,1 billion kg of wildlife items only measured in weight. A shipment refers to any container or group of containers that share a common control number, country of shipment and shipment date. Each shipment may be represented in the lemis dataset by multiple segments or rows, because the contents are derived from more than one species or type of product. We will carry out different analysis. We’ll analyze the data based on the type of segments. We’ll include information about the volume and content. We’ll analyze general trends: number of shipments and segments, percentage of refused shipments, money spent and amount of items. We’ll analyze the amount of money spent based on different categories. 7.3 KEY FINDINGS 7.4 ANALYSIS BASED ON THE TYPE OF SEGMENT There are 2,079,637 unique shipments containing 5,451,832 segments. Of those, 60% (1,265,491 unique shipments) represent single segments. It means that for 1,265,491 shipments only one species and one type of product were discovered. The remaining 40% (814,146 unique shipments) contain 4,186,341 segments. These multiple segments shipments contain from 2 to 492 segments. The average number of segments in this kind of shipments is 5; the median is 3. 7.4.1 Description It represents the type/form of the wildlife product. The FWS Import/Export Key recognizes 94 different descriptions for wildlife items, although only 87 of them were used in this dataset. Based on the types of items by segment, most of them contain “Live specimens” (29%), followed by trophies (17%), “shell products” (9%), small leather products (7%) and jewelry (6%). Together, the top-five descriptions represent 68% of all segments (Figure 1) The description “live specimen” is the most common one. It refers to live animals and is mainly made up of corals (38%) and fishes (23%). The second most common description is “trophy”,which refers to all the parts of one animal, if they are exported together (e.g. horns, skull, cape, backskin, tail and feet constitute one trophy). It’s almost entirely made from mammals (89%). “Shell products” (from mollusc or turtle) are almost entirely derived from shells (98%). The description “small leather products” includes belts, handbags, wallets and watch bands. Most of them are derived from from reptiles (81%). Finally, the “jewelry” description (other than ivory jewelry) is mainly derived from shells (93%) (Figure 2). If we take into account the quantity of items in trade (instead of the type of segment): Based on the number of items, jewelry (other than ivory), shell (mollusc, raw or unworked), feather, hair product (including paint brush) and egg (dead or blown, excluding caviar) are the most common products (Figure 3). And based on the kg of items, meat, dead animal (whole animal), frog leg, live specimen and shell are the most common products (Figure 4 and 5). 7.4.2 Purpose It represents the declared reason the wildlife product is being imported. It’s declared by the importer. The FWS Import/Export Key recognizes 12 different purposes of import and all of them were used in this dataset. Based on the types of items by segment, most of them were imported for “Commercial” (75%) and “hunting trophies” (18%) purposes. Together, both purposes represent 92% of all segments (Figure 6) Most of the segments were imported for commercial purposes. Most of their items came from shells (27%), corals (17%) and reptils (17%). The second most common purpose was “hunting trophies”. These imports involved mainly mammals (87%) and birds (13%). Personal imports involved mammals (49%), birds (14%) and reptiles (13%) (Figure 7). If we take into account the quantity of items in trade (instead of the type of segment): Based on the number of items, “reintroduction/introduction into the wild”, “breeding in captivity or artificial propagation” and “scientific” are the most common purposes (Figure 8). And based on the kg of items, “commercial” and “hunting trophies” are the most common purposes (Figure 9). 7.4.3 Source Based on the source of the items by segment, the most common sources in the segments are “specimens taken from the wild” (78%) and “animals bred in captivity” (15%). 7.4.4 Ports, countries and trade routes This involves the ports of entry, the country of export and the country of origin. Shipments comes from 252 different countries of origin, although 75% of all the imports comes from the same 15 countries. The top-five countries of origin were Indonesia (15%), Canada (10%), South Africa (9%), Philippines (8%) and China (7%). Shipments were exported to the UUEE from 257 different countries, although 75% of all the imports were exported from the same 15 countries. The top-five countries of export were Canada (12%), Indonesia (12%), South Africa (8%), Philippines (8%) and Italy (7%) Although there are around 328 ports of entry into the EEUU, only 73 of them are represented in this dataset. This is because not all of them are covered by FWS wildlife inspectors. By law, only 18 of them are designated ports with full-time inspectors. Based on the number of imports, the top-five ports of entry were Los Angeles (20%), New York(19%), Miami(6%), Newark(5%) and San Francisco(5%). The top-five most used trade routes (country of export to port of entry) emerged from this analysis were: Indonesia to Los Angeles, CA (7%), Italy to New York, NY (4%), South Africa to New York, NY (2%), Hong Kong SAR China to New York, NY (2%) and Philippines to Los Angeles, CA (2%). 7.4.5 Refused segments 98.28% of imports were legally declared, just 1.73% was refused. Most of the refused shipments included items related with mammals (28%) and reptils (27%). The top-five countries of origin were: Unknown (24%), Mexico (14%), Canada (7%), Indonesia (6%) and China (6%). The top-five countries of export were: Mexico (19%), Canada (10%), China (8%), Indonesia (5%) and Philippines (4%) The top-five ports were: New York, NY (9%), El Paso, TX (8%), Anchorage, AK (8%), Los Angeles, CA (8%), San Francisco, CA (6%). DISPOSITION: How many were seized? (%) 7.5 ANALYSIS BY TRENDS The trends analysis will focus on the number of shipments, the import (US dollars), the contents and the capacity of deter ilegal shipments (refused shipments). 7.5.1 Wildlife shipments and segments In the 15 years analyzed, there are 2,079,637 unique shipments containing 5,451,832 segments. We can see a clear upward trend in the number of cases from 2000 to 2006. Then, the curve reached its peak with around 162,000 unique shipments, decreased a bit, and started leveling off. 7.5.2 Import (US dollars) There has been an upward trend in the amount of dollars spent from 2000 to 2012 (Although we don’t have enough information about this variable in the data produced between 2008-2011 and 2013-2014. For more information, check the section 2.1.1.). Items that involved mammals, shells and reptiles generate the highest amount of money throughout the years 7.5.3 Content/quantity 7.5.4 Refused segments As we mentioned before, 98.28% of imports were legally declared, just 1.73% was refused. 7.6 MONEY SPENT BY CATEGORY 7.6.1 Pending info 54% of dispositions took place within a month of the shipment date (most of them within a week) "]
