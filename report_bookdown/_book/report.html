<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>The aim of this study is to analyze United States wildlife and wildlife product imports. For this purpose, we reviewed 15 years (2000-2014) of data from the Law Enforcement Managment Information System (LEMIS), originally collected by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), cleaned, standardized and stored into a R package called lemis by EcoHealth Alliance. You can find more information about this dataset <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0354-5">Here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>The description “live specimens” and “trophies” was ranked as the first two based on the number of segments.</strong> Although jewelry and shells were the items with a higher number of items and meat was the item with a higher amount of kg.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Most of the items were “specimens taken from the wild” and imported for “commercial” reasons.</strong></li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Most problematic countries were Indonesia, Canada, South Africa and The Philippines.</strong> All of them are in the top five countries of origin and in the top five countries of export. The top five ports of entry (Los Angeles, New York, Miami, Newark and San Francisco) were all designated ports.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Half of the segments involved mammals and shells.</strong> And the top-five genus levels were Pinctada, Alligator, Ursus, Python and Mustela.</li>

<p>METHOD AND DATA INCLUDED
The data collected by EcoHealth Alliance includes records of plants, microorganisms and animals, among others. For this analysis, we’ll exclude those elements belonging to fungi, plantae, bacteria, chromista and unspecified kingdoms, considering only those organisms of the Kingdom Animalia.</p>
<p>Between January 01, 2000, and December 31, 2014, around <strong>2 million wildlife shipments were imported into the United States</strong>, involving around 11,5 billions of wildlife items plus 1,1 billion kg of wildlife items only measured in weight.</p>
<p>A <strong>shipment</strong> refers to any container or group of containers that share a common control number, country of shipment and shipment date. Each shipment may be represented in the lemis dataset by multiple <strong>segments</strong> or rows, because the contents are derived from more than one species or type of product.</p>
<p>The dataset includes taxonomic information (e.g., taxa, genus or species), wildlife description (type/form of the product such as “live specimens” or “jewelry”), quantity, unit (of the quantity metric, e.g. number or kg), value of the product (reported in US dollars), country of origin, country of export, purpose, source, action taken by USFWS on import, disposition of the shipment, disposition date, disposition year, shipment date, shipment year, import_export (whether the shipment was being imported to the EEUU or exported from the EEUU), port of entry, the US importing party, the foreign exporting party and cleaning notes generated during data cleaning. (See Appendix A and Appendix B for more information about data fields).</p>
<p>We carried out three types of analyses:</p>
<ul>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We carried out an exploratory analysis of the whole dataset, looking for relevant insights about the volume and the content.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We analyzed general trends: number of shipments, percentage of refused shipments, money spent and amount of items.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>A total of 2,079,637 unique shipments containing 5,451,832 segments were identified between January 01, 2000, and December 31, 2014.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Of those, 60% (1,265,491 unique shipments) represented single segments. It means that for 1,265,491 shipments only one species and one type of product were discovered. The remaining 40% (814,146 unique shipments) contained 4,186,341 segments.</p></li>
<li><p>These multiple segments shipments contained from 2 to 492 segments. The average number of segments in this kind of shipments was 5; the median was 3.</p></li>

<p><strong>It represents the type/form of the wildlife product</strong>. The FWS Import/Export Key recognizes 94 different descriptions for wildlife items, although only 87 of them were used in this dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the types of items by segment</strong>, most of them contain “Live specimens” (29%), followed by trophies (17%), “shell products” (9%), small leather products (7%) and jewelry (6%). Together, the top-five descriptions represent 68% of all segments (Figure 1)</p>
<iframe src="./plotly/description.html" width="100%" height="400" id="igraph" scrolling="no" seamless="seamless" frameBorder="0">

<p>The description “live specimen” is the most common one. It refers to live animals and is mainly made up of corals (38%) and fish (23%). The second most common description is “trophy”,which refers to all the parts of one animal, if they are exported together (e.g. horns, skull, cape, backskin, tail and feet constitute one trophy). It’s almost entirely made from mammals (89%). “Shell products” (from mollusc or turtle) are almost entirely derived from shells (98%). The description “small leather products” includes belts, handbags, wallets and watch bands. Most of them are derived from reptiles (81%). Finally, the “jewelry” description (other than ivory jewelry) is mainly derived from shells (93%) (Figure 2).</p>

<strong>If we analyze the amount of money spent by shipment year and taxa</strong>, we find that items that involve mammals, shells and reptiles generate the highest amount of money throughout the years, while items that involve annelids and spiders generate the lowest amount of money (Figure 42).</p>

<p><strong>If we analyze the amount of money spent by shipment year and description</strong>, we find that items that involve shell products, garment and live specimens have generated a high amount of money throughout the years, although items that involve dead animals and meat have increased dramatically the amount of money since 2008 (Figure 43).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.4.3</span> Quantity</h3>
<p>We summarized the quantity bought per year. We only included in the analysis those items measured in “number” and “kg” units, because they represented 99.45% of the data. It included around 11,5 billions of wildlife items plus 1,1 billion kg of wildlife items only measured in weight (Figure Figure 44 and 45).</p>

<p>As we mentioned before, 98.28% of imports were legally declared, just 1.73% was refused. We can see that refused segments have been decreasing slightly since 2009 (Figure 46).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.5</span> MONEY SPENT</h2>
<p><strong>We analyzed what are the taxa and descriptions that spent the higher amount of money (by total import and average import) during this period of time.</strong></p>
<p>If we analyze the data based on the total import, items that involved mammals, shell and reptiles generate the highest amount of money (Figure 47).</p>
<p><em>Mammal</em> was the taxa with the highest expense (around 7 billion dollars). More than a half of this amount derived from items that involved garment (22%), ivory carving (22%) and skin (18%).</p>
<p><em>Shell</em> was the taxa with the second highest expense (around 4 billion dollars). Most of this amount derived from items that involved shell products (52%), meat (24%) and jewelry (15%).</p>
<p><em>Reptile</em> was the taxa with the third highest expense (around 2.7 billion dollars). Most of this amount derived from items that involved small leather products (46%), shoes (28%) and large leather products (10%).</p>

<p>Although, if we analyzed the data based on the average import, items that involved reptiles and mammals had the highest average import by unit (Figure 48). And items that involved echinoderms and annelid had the highest average import by kg (Figure 49).</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.6</span> LIMITATIONS</h2>
<p>As with all studies, there are some limitations we should bear in mind. First, the LEMIS dataset covers only those imports cleared and refused by the wildlife inspectors. So, there will be many illegal shipments not included in this analysis. Second, there is a lack of precision in the species analysis because part of the data includes missing values and generic identifiers like “sp”, “tropical fish” or “marine sp.” Third, we don’t know how representative this study is of the international trade in wildlife, since the LEMIS dataset is only focused on the imports into the EEUU.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, we hope these results can help to understand more deeply the situation of wildlife trafficking into the EEUU and take things a step further understanding the big picture of the global trade of wildlife.</p>
